# Introduction

## What is this project?

This project is an **AI-powered insights agent** designed to help you keep track of everything happening inside fast-moving **crypto communities on Telegram**.  
Instead of reading hundreds (or even thousands) of messages every week, you'll receive a **clear and structured summary** that highlights only the most important updates, discussions, and insights.

Think of it as your **personal community analyst**: it reads, summarizes, and connects the dots for you — so you can focus on decision-making, not endless scrolling.

## The Problem

Crypto and Web3 projects evolve at a rapid pace. Communities on Telegram share:
- announcements from the core team,
- governance proposals,
- product updates,
- partnerships,
- market rumors,
- and day-to-day discussions.

But keeping up with all this in real time is almost impossible. Important information often gets buried under memes, spam, and noise. Missing key updates can mean **lost opportunities** or **being out of the loop**.

Additionally, processing large volumes of messages with AI can become expensive without knowing the cost upfront.

## The Solution

Our agent automatically:
1. **Continuously collects messages** from the selected Telegram channels and groups.  
2. **Stores them in SQLite** for efficient access and processing.  
3. **Estimates costs** before processing to help you make informed decisions.  
4. **Generates summaries on-demand** for specific date ranges with context from previous summaries.  
5. **Builds continuity** across summaries — connecting new updates with what happened before.  
6. **Creates shareable content**, like Twitter (X) threads, based on the summaries.

## Key Features

- **Daily Message Collection**: Automatically extracts and stores messages from Telegram groups.
- **Cost Estimation**: Calculates expected LLM processing costs before summarization.
- **Checkpoint Summaries**: Generate summaries for specific date ranges with context from previous summaries.
- **Project Analysis**: One-time analysis of project documentation for better context.
- **Message Linking**: Every highlight includes a direct link to the original Telegram message.  
- **Contextual Summaries**: Summaries build on previous ones to show continuity and progress.  
- **Twitter Thread Generation**: Automatically draft ready-to-post Twitter (X) threads to share updates with your audience.  
- **Noise Reduction**: Removes irrelevant chatter, memes, or spam so you only see what matters.

## How It Works

1. **Setup**: You provide a Telegram group link and project documentation.
2. **Continuous Collection**: Our system automatically extracts and stores messages in SQLite.
3. **Cost Estimation**: When you want a summary, the system estimates the cost based on message count.
4. **On-Demand Summarization**: You choose the date range and the system generates a summary using context from previous summaries.
5. **Output**: You receive a structured summary with links to important messages.

## The Vision

Our vision is to become the **go-to AI companion** for crypto community intelligence.  
By combining advanced **language models** with efficient data storage and cost transparency, we aim to transform raw community noise into **actionable insights**, making sure you never miss an important update again while keeping costs predictable and manageable.
