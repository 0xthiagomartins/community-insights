# Twitter/X Threads

The Crypto Community Insights Agent can automatically create **ready-to-post Twitter (X) threads** based on your weekly digest.  
This allows you to **share insights with your audience quickly and efficiently**.

---

## How It Works

1. **Digest Analysis**  
   - The agent reviews the weekly digest highlights.  
   - Key points, updates, and community decisions are identified.

2. **Thread Draft Creation**  
   - Each highlight becomes a thread item.  
   - Items are ordered logically for storytelling (from major announcements to community updates).

3. **Context Linking**  
   - Threads reference previous events when necessary.  
   - This maintains continuity week to week.

4. **Review & Publish**  
   - You receive a **draft thread** for review.  
   - Nothing is posted automatically â€” you approve and publish when ready.
