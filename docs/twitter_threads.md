# Twitter/X Threads (Phase 2 - Future Feature)

> **⚠️ Note:** This feature is planned for Phase 2 and is NOT part of the current MVP scope.

The Crypto Community Insights Agent will automatically create **ready-to-post Twitter (X) threads** based on your weekly digest.  
This will allow you to **share insights with your audience quickly and efficiently**.

## How It Will Work (Future Implementation)

1. **Digest Analysis**  
   - The agent will review the weekly digest highlights.  
   - Key points, updates, and community decisions will be identified.

2. **Thread Draft Creation**  
   - Each highlight will become a thread item.  
   - Items will be ordered logically for storytelling (from major announcements to community updates).

3. **Context Linking**  
   - Threads will reference previous events when necessary.  
   - This will maintain continuity week to week.

4. **Review & Publish**  
   - You will receive a **draft thread** for review.  
   - Nothing will be posted automatically — you approve and publish when ready.
